# Chat Application

This project is a simple chat application built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **TypeScript**, and **FastAPI**. The app allows users to send messages to a chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT model.

## Features

- **Real-time Chat**: Send and receive messages with a chatbot.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses GPT-4 model (or GPT-3.5 based on your preference) to generate responses.
- **Responsive UI**: Built using Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive design.
- **FastAPI Backend**: Handles API requests and integrates with OpenAI API to generate responses.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI, OpenAI API
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **API Communication**: Fetch API (for async HTTP requests)
- **Environment Variables**: dotenv for managing API keys

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Node.js and npm (or Yarn)
- OpenAI API Key (create an account on [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/signup/) and get your API key)
- A `.env` file to store your OpenAI API key

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-application.git
cd chat-application
\`\`\`

### 2. Backend (FastAPI)

- Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies.

\`\`\`bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
venv\\Scripts\\activate  # For Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

- Create a `.env` file in the backend directory to store your OpenAI API key:

\`\`\`
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
\`\`\`

- Run the FastAPI backend:

\`\`\`bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
\`\`\`

The server will start at \`http://127.0.0.1:8000\`.

### 3. Frontend (React + Tailwind CSS)

- Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies.

\`\`\`bash
cd frontend
npm install
\`\`\`

- To start the React application:

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

The frontend will start at \`http://127.0.0.1:5173\`.

### 4. CORS Configuration

Ensure that your FastAPI backend allows requests from your frontend. In the provided code, CORS is configured to accept requests from \`http://localhost:5173\`, which is the default port for Vite-based React applications.

## Running the App

1. Make sure both the backend and frontend servers are running.
2. Open your browser and go to \`http://localhost:5173\` (the React frontend).
3. Type a message in the input box and hit "Enter" to interact with the chatbot.

## API Endpoints

### \`GET /\`

A simple endpoint to check the status of the server.

**Response**:

\`\`\`json
{
  "message": "Welcome"
}
\`\`\`

### \`GET /response\`

A test endpoint for checking the server response.

**Response**:

\`\`\`json
{
  "response": "responding with lights and sirens"
}
\`\`\`

### \`POST /chat\`

Send a message to the chatbot and get a response.

**Request Body**:

\`\`\`json
{
  "message": "Hello, chatbot!"
}
\`\`\`

**Response**:

\`\`\`json
{
  "response": "Hello, how can I assist you today?"
}
\`\`\`

## Deployment

- To deploy this application, you can use services like **Heroku**, **AWS**, **DigitalOcean**, or any other hosting platform for both the backend and frontend.
- You will need to set up environment variables for the OpenAI API key in the production environment.

## Future Improvements

- Add user authentication for personalized interactions.
- Support for rich media (images, links) in messages.
- Better error handling and input validation.
- Deploy to production using Docker.
